Description: Our project will be a dungeon style game, similar to the Binding of Isaac/Enter the Gungeon.  The player will play as a ninja and fight through multiple rooms with many enemies, with each room being its own contained battle. There will also be power ups and other weapons the player can pick up along the way that will randomly spawn. In the last room, the player will fight a boss in a battle resembling a bullet hell, which will involve weaving between projectiles while returning fire.
